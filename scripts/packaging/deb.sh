# --- AppArmor profile for the Cowork bwrap sandbox helper ---
# Cowork's "bwrap backend" runs the agent's Claude Code process inside a
# bubblewrap sandbox, which itself needs unprivileged user namespaces — the
# same thing Ubuntu 24.04+ blocks (apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1).
# bwrap is a SEPARATE binary from the Electron app, so the shvia-desktop
# profile above (which scopes the Electron binary) does not cover it; it
# needs its own profile on /usr/bin/bwrap. Without this, Cowork silently
# falls back to host-direct (no isolation).
#
# Gate on the kernel knob, exactly like the Electron block above: only a
# kernel that can enforce the restriction exposes the knob, and a userspace
# parser that merely accepts the userns rule (AppArmor 4) is not
# enforcement — without the knob the profile is dead weight on a binary
# this package does not own. There is deliberately no [ -x /usr/bin/bwrap ]
# gate: a profile attaching to a nonexistent binary is inert, and dpkg
# gives Recommends no ordering edge, so gating on the binary races a
# same-transaction bubblewrap install. Static checks only: postinst runs as
# root, which is exempt from the unprivileged-userns restriction, so a
# behavioral bwrap probe here would falsely pass — the behavioral probe
# lives in 'shvia-desktop --doctor' instead (runs as the user).
