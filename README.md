# SHVIA-DESKTOP

**SHVIA-DESKTOP** packages [Claude Desktop](https://www.anthropic.com) — Anthropic's desktop app — to run natively on Linux. It repackages the official Windows application for Linux, producing `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm` (Fedora/RHEL), and distribution-agnostic AppImage packages, plus a Nix flake for NixOS. The installed package is named `shvia-desktop`.

**Note:** This is an unofficial build, not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic. For official support, visit [Anthropic's website](https://www.anthropic.com). For issues with these build scripts or the Linux implementation, [open an issue](https://github.com/samirhvbr/SHVIA-DESKTOP/issues) in this repository.

## Installation

### Building from Source (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samirhvbr/SHVIA-DESKTOP.git
cd SHVIA-DESKTOP
./build.sh --build deb --clean yes   # or: --build appimage  /  --build rpm
```

The build produces `shvia-desktop_<version>_<arch>.deb` (or the matching `.rpm` / `.AppImage`). See [docs/building.md](docs/building.md) for all flags, formats, and dependencies.

### Pre-built Releases

Download the latest `.deb`, `.rpm`, or `.AppImage` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/samirhvbr/SHVIA-DESKTOP/releases) (when published).

### Using Nix Flake (NixOS)

```bash
# Basic install
nix profile install github:samirhvbr/SHVIA-DESKTOP

# With MCP server support (FHS environment)
nix profile install github:samirhvbr/SHVIA-DESKTOP#shvia-desktop-fhs
```

Or add to your NixOS configuration:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.shvia-desktop.url = "github:samirhvbr/SHVIA-DESKTOP";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, shvia-desktop, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.myhost = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        ({ pkgs, ... }: {
          nixpkgs.overlays = [ shvia-desktop.overlays.default ];
          environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.shvia-desktop ];
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

## Configuration

Model Context Protocol settings are stored in:
```
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

For additional configuration options including environment variables and Wayland support, see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Troubleshooting

Run `shvia-desktop --doctor` for built-in diagnostics that check common issues (display server, sandbox permissions, MCP config, stale locks, and more). It also reports cowork mode readiness — which isolation backend will be used, and which dependencies (KVM, QEMU, vsock, socat, virtiofsd, bubblewrap) are installed or missing.

For additional troubleshooting, uninstallation instructions, and log locations, see [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

- **[ProfFlow](https://github.com/ProfFlow)** for re-fixing the RPM repodata signing regression by appending `!` to the keyid passed to `gpg --default-key`, forcing `repomd.xml` to be signed by the primary key instead of the auto-selected signing subkey (#566)
- **[jslatten](https://github.com/jslatten)** for fixing the KDE Plasma Wayland launcher-grouping bug by setting `pkg.desktopName` in the packaged `app.asar`'s `package.json`, format-conditional so deb/rpm get `claude-desktop.desktop` and AppImage gets `io.github.aaddrick.claude-desktop-debian.desktop` (#562)

- **[Hayao0819](https://github.com/Hayao0819)** for diagnosing the upstream `titleBarStyle:""` → `titleBarStyle:"hiddenInset"` migration that broke the About window render on GNOME/X11 and contributing the `isPopupWindow()` match extension (#481, #489)
- **[michelsfun](https://github.com/michelsfun)** for reporting the cowork `ENAMETOOLONG` failure on eCryptfs-encrypted home directories with detailed `--doctor` output that pinpointed the short-NAME_MAX filesystem as the cause (#590)
- **[proffalken](https://github.com/proffalken)** for the LUKS-volume + `pam_mount` workaround documented in `docs/troubleshooting.md`, restoring cowork support on legacy eCryptfs-encrypted home directories (#590)
- **[phelps-matthew](https://github.com/phelps-matthew)** for fixing `CLAUDE_QUIT_ON_CLOSE=1` to actively quit via `app.quit()` instead of relying on the bundled handler that hardcodes hide-to-tray on Linux, with thorough root cause analysis and alternatives evaluation (#624, #623)
- **[dubreal](https://github.com/dubreal)** for `--password-store` keyring detection that probes D-Bus for kwallet6 / gnome-libsecret at startup, fixing session persistence on KDE Plasma and other desktops where Electron's `safeStorage` was unavailable (#611, #593)
- **[JustinJLeopard](https://github.com/JustinJLeopard)** for detecting missing electron binaries after Node 24's `extract-zip` silently no-ops, with an `unzip` fallback that recovers from the `@electron/get` cache (#631, #584)
- **[tkrag](https://github.com/tkrag)** for diagnosing and fixing the X11 window-raise-on-hover bug under sloppy/focus-follows-mouse WMs, tracing the upstream `webContents.focus()` → `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` path through three iterations of review (#589, #416)
- **[maplefater](https://github.com/maplefater)** for re-anchoring the `addTrustedFolder` `.asar` guard on the `async addTrustedFolder(…)` method declaration after upstream 1.10628.x folded the log call into a comma-expression, keying both the parameter extraction and the injection point off the unminified method name so they can't drift apart (#685)
- **[MitchSchwartz](https://github.com/MitchSchwartz)** for finding the second `app.asar` file-drop path — the `existsSync()` branch in the second-instance argv collector that #640 never guarded — and rejecting `.asar` paths there so the app no longer prompts to attach its own bundle on every taskbar reopen (#669, #668)
- **[LiukScot](https://github.com/LiukScot)** for making the tray rebuild mutex trailing-edge so the startup dark-theme icon no longer latches black, and restoring the in-place `setImage` fast-path after upstream changed the context-menu wiring to a prebuilt menu object (#680, #679)
- **[sabiut](https://github.com/sabiut)**
  - BATS coverage for `cleanup_orphaned_cowork_daemon`, mutation-tested so the kill/escalation branches genuinely bite (#693)
  - Fixing two false-green `--doctor` PASSes: an empty password store read as healthy, and a non-numeric `df` reading falling through to the PASS branch (#692)
  - Extending the artifact launch smoke tests to arm64 on native `ubuntu-22.04-arm` runners, and re-keying the AppImage pkill sweep to `mount_claude` so escaped zygote/electron children stop leaking on the runner (#691)
- **[jerem](https://github.com/jerem)** for routing Quick Entry's global shortcut through the XDG GlobalShortcuts portal on native Wayland, and merging all Chromium feature requests into a single `--enable-features=` switch — the old code silently clobbered `WindowControlsOverlay` (#690, #404)
- **[caidejager](https://github.com/caidejager)** for diagnosing why Cowork's VM daemon never auto-launched on packages built under a restrictive umask — `app.asar.unpacked/` shipped mode `0700`, failing the auto-launch `existsSync()` guard — and normalizing install permissions across deb and AppImage, with `dpkg-deb --root-owner-group` closing a build-uid write exposure (#695)
- **[JustinJLeopard](https://github.com/JustinJLeopard)** for the AppStream metainfo that surfaces the package in GNOME Software, KDE Discover, and App Center, wired into the deb, rpm, and AppImage builds (#633)
- **[DhanushSantosh](https://github.com/DhanushSantosh)** for the GPU crash auto-recovery in the launcher: detecting a previous GPU-process FATAL in the launcher log and re-launching with safe GPU flags automatically, instead of leaving users to discover `CLAUDE_DISABLE_GPU=1` by hand (#666)
- **[diarized](https://github.com/diarized)** for auto-installing scoped AppArmor userns profiles from the `.deb` postinst on Ubuntu 24.04+ — one for the bundled Electron binary (fixing the launch crash without `--no-sandbox`) and one for `/usr/bin/bwrap` (keeping Cowork's sandbox isolated instead of silently falling back to host-direct), automating the workaround from #351 (#687, #694)
- **[emandel82](https://github.com/emandel82)** for root-causing the "Attach app.asar?" prompt: every launcher passed `app.asar` as a redundant Electron argument, which the second-instance argv collector treated as a file to open — removed at the source across all four package formats (#700, #696)
- **[svankirk](https://github.com/svankirk)** for cleaning up Desktop helper processes after an explicit quit — a quit wrapper with signal forwarding and a bundle-keyed live-UI check, so closing the app no longer strands helper processes (#682)
- **[pjordanandrsn](https://github.com/pjordanandrsn)** for re-deriving the cowork Linux patch suite against the upstream "yukonSilver" VM refactor (1.13576+) — re-anchoring the platform gate on `startVM`'s `yukonSilver.status` check after Patch 1's removed `darwin`/`win32` anchor started `process.exit(1)`'ing and dropping every subsequent cowork patch, fixing the build's "Verify cowork patches in shipped asar" gate (#736)
- **[chrisw1005](https://github.com/chrisw1005)** for root-causing the Linux startup hang on Claude Desktop 1.13576+ — the unconditional `@ant/claude-native.readRegistryValues()` / `getWindowsElevationType()` enterprise-policy calls throwing a swallowed missing-method `TypeError` before window creation — via probe injection, and the complete Windows-only native stub fix (#729)
- **[colonelpanic8](https://github.com/colonelpanic8)** for independently reproducing the same 1.13576+ startup hang and contributing BATS coverage for the Linux native stub (#730)
