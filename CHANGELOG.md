# Changelog

All notable changes to `samirhvbr/SHVIA-DESKTOP` are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) — semantic versioning applies to `REPO_VERSION`; upstream Claude Desktop bumps (the `+claude{X.Y.Z}` suffix on the tag) are tracked separately by the `check-claude-version` workflow.

## [Unreleased]

<!-- Updated automatically by check-claude-version; will be current at release time. -->

### Fixed

- The tray in-place fast-path applies again on Claude Desktop 1.13576+ (verified against 1.15962.0). The "yukonSilver"-era refactor restructured the tray rebuild block — the destroy/recreate is now guarded by `if(X=[],Y=!1,TRAY&&(TRAY.destroy()…),!enabled)` instead of `;if(TRAY&&(TRAY.destroy()`, and the context menu became a prebuilt object (`M=BUILDER();TRAY.setContextMenu(M)`) with a leading `setContextMenu(null)` menu-clear. The patch's `head -1` latched that `null` clear, so the menu builder never resolved, the #680 WARNING fired, and the fast-path was skipped — silently re-arming the #515 KDE/Plasma duplicate-icon StatusNotifier race because tray patches warn-and-continue. The menu-function resolver now walks every `setContextMenu` argument, skips the `null` clear, and resolves the real builder; the injection anchors on the `;if(` that opens the destroy statement so it lands in both the old and new shapes. New `tests/tray-patches.bats` covers builder resolution, injection placement, idempotency, the loud-fail-on-missing-anchor path, and the menu-bar-default cases. ([#746](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/746) investigation)
- `patch_menu_bar_default` no longer reports a bare "pattern not found" on 1.13576+. Upstream moved `menuBarEnabled` behind a settings getter backed by a defaults map that already ships `menuBarEnabled:!0`, so the legacy `!!`-default rewrite is a no-op by design. The patch now distinguishes that case from a genuine miss and warns loudly only if neither the legacy anchor nor the upstream default is present (i.e. the default ever flips back to off).

## [v2.0.22] — 2026-06-25

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.15200.0.

### Fixed

- The Cowork tab is no longer grayed out on Linux with a *"Cowork requires a newer installation — Reinstall the desktop app"* tooltip. Upstream 1.13576+ gates the tab's visibility on the yukonSilver support *evaluator* (`$oe`/`q4r`, the Windows capability probe), which returns `msix_required` on Linux — a separate consumer from the `startVM` execution gate that [#736](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/736) re-derived. The evaluator now reports `supported` on Linux so the renderer un-grays the tab (the bwrap daemon was already healthy underneath), while the VM-image download drivers it also feeds are re-blocked so they don't pull the multi-GB `rootfs.vhdx` bundle that is intentionally disabled on Linux — cowork runs through the bwrap sandbox, not a downloaded VM. ([#743](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/743), #736 follow-up)
- Claude Desktop no longer hangs at startup on Linux with no window ever appearing (a regression introduced by upstream 1.13576+). The bundle calls the Windows-only `@ant/claude-native` methods `readRegistryValues()` and `getWindowsElevationType()` unconditionally during its enterprise-policy lookup, guarding only the native module being null and not the method being absent — so the Linux stub threw `"<method> is not a function"` at top-level execution, which the early empty `uncaughtException` handler swallowed, leaving the process alive but windowless. The Linux native stub now provides neutral no-ops for these Windows-only registry / MSIX / UAC methods. ([#729](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/729))
- Cowork Linux patches apply again on Claude Desktop 1.13576+ — the build's "Verify cowork patches in shipped asar" step had started failing with 9/11 markers missing. Upstream re-architected the cowork/VM subsystem ("yukonSilver") between 1.12603.1 and 1.13576.0: the platform gate moved from a `darwin`/`win32` check into `startVM`'s `yukonSilver.status` feature-flag check, the vmClient module load moved behind the isMsix detector, and `sharedCwdPath`/`mountConda` were removed. Patch 1 (which anchored on the gone check) `process.exit(1)`'d, which killed the whole node block and dropped every subsequent cowork patch. Patches 1, 2 and the daemon auto-launch anchor were re-derived against the new bundle, the smol-bin idempotency guard was fixed (it false-matched upstream's own log), the obsolete `sharedCwdPath` threading (Patch 12) was retired in favor of the daemon's mountMap fallback, and the Linux smol-bin copy patch gained a verification marker. ([#736](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/736))
- Builds (deb, RPM, AppImage, nix) no longer abort in the patch phase with `FATAL: --add-dir pattern matches 2 times (expected 1)`. Upstream Claude Desktop 1.12603.1 ships two identical `--add-dir` dispatch loops, but the `.asar` filter patch ([#650](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/650)) asserted exactly one. The patch now filters every matching dispatch loop instead of bailing on a duplicate, and stays idempotent on re-runs. ([#718](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/718))
- `claude-desktop --doctor` reports the installed version from the package manager that actually owns the install (probed via `rpm -qf` on the bundled Electron binary) instead of trusting `dpkg-query` alone — rpm installs on hosts that also carry a stale dpkg record (e.g. Fedora boxes with dpkg installed as a build tool) no longer show a months-old version with a PASS. ([#712](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/712), fixes [#711](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/711))

## [v2.0.19] — 2026-06-10

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.11847.5.

### Added

- AppStream metainfo (`io.github.aaddrick.claude-desktop-debian.metainfo.xml`) installed by the deb, RPM, and AppImage builds, so the package appears in GNOME Software, KDE Discover, and App Center with correct unofficial-repackaging branding and a `LicenseRef-proprietary` project license. Store search for not-yet-installed users needs repo-side DEP-11/appstream metadata, tracked in [#708](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/708). ([#633](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/633))
- GPU crash auto-recovery in the launcher: when the previous launch died to a Chromium GPU-process FATAL (the [#583](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/583) SIGTRAP signature), the next launch automatically applies safe GPU flags — and stays recovered on subsequent launches instead of oscillating crash/work/crash. Detects NixOS launcher log headers too; set `CLAUDE_DISABLE_GPU=0` to override. ([#666](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/666))

### Fixed

- `claude-desktop --doctor` no longer reports a false-green PASS when the password store reads back empty or when `df` returns a non-numeric disk reading — bad reads now fail or print a visible skip instead of falling through to the PASS branch, and leading-zero `df` output can no longer slip past as octal arithmetic. ([#692](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/692))
- Explicit quit now keeps the launcher alive until Electron exits, then runs
  stale-helper cleanup for Desktop-owned Cowork, Claude config, and extension
  helpers. Close-to-tray still leaves the app and helpers running.
  ([#682](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/682))
- All launchers (deb, RPM, AppImage, nix) no longer pass `app.asar` as an Electron
  argument. Electron auto-loads `app.asar` from its default `resources/` dir next to the
  binary, so the extra argv entry was redundant — and the app treated it as a
  file-to-open, surfacing a spurious "Attach app.asar?" prompt on launch and on every
  taskbar reopen. This removes the path at the source, complementing the renderer-side
  `.asar` guards in [#669](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/669)
  and surviving upstream re-minification. Live-UI detection in the launcher and doctor,
  which fingerprinted on the now-removed argv, was updated alongside.
  ([#700](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/700),
  fixes [#696](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/696))
- Cowork's VM daemon never auto-launched on packages built under a restrictive umask (CI builds with umask `022`, so released artifacts were unaffected; local builds with e.g. `umask 077` were) because the bundled `app.asar.unpacked/` directory shipped as mode `0700` owned by the build uid, so the desktop user running the app couldn't traverse it and the auto-launch `fs.existsSync()` fork guard silently returned `false` (symptom: endless `connect ENOENT …/cowork-vm-service.sock`, no `cowork_vm_daemon.log`, no `[cowork-autolaunch]` line). `deb.sh` now normalizes the installed tree to canonical permissions (directories and executables `755`, other files `644`) and builds with `dpkg-deb --root-owner-group` for `root:root` ownership; `appimage.sh` applies the same normalization to the AppDir before `mksquashfs` (it copies with `cp -a`, which preserved the bad modes); and `rpm.sh` normalizes file modes in `%install` — `%defattr(-, root, root, 0755)` forces directory modes in the payload, but its `-` first field preserves file modes from the `cp -r`-populated buildroot, so a restrictive-umask RPM build shipped an unreadable `app.asar` and a non-executable electron binary.
- Claude Desktop no longer crashes on launch on Ubuntu 24.04+, where `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` blocks the user namespaces Chromium's sandbox needs (`sandbox/linux/services/credentials.cc` FATAL, `Trace/breakpoint trap`, exit 133). The `.deb` `postinst` now installs a scoped AppArmor profile granting `userns` to the bundled Electron binary — mirroring the `google-chrome`/`code`/`slack` packages — and removes it again on uninstall. The Chromium sandbox stays enabled (no `--no-sandbox`). `claude-desktop --doctor` gained a **User namespaces** check that flags a missing profile. ([#687](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/687))
- Cowork mode no longer silently falls back to host-direct (no isolation) on Ubuntu 24.04+, where `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` blocks the user namespaces its bubblewrap sandbox needs. The `.deb` `postinst` now installs a second scoped AppArmor profile granting `userns` to `/usr/bin/bwrap` (distinct from the Electron profile above), automating the manual workaround from [#351](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/351) (contributed by [@hfyeh](https://github.com/hfyeh)). The profile is gated on the kernel's `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` knob and defers to any profile already attaching to `/usr/bin/bwrap` (a hand-made `/etc/apparmor.d/bwrap`, `apparmor-profiles`' `bwrap-userns-restrict`); put local overrides in `/etc/apparmor.d/local/claude-desktop-bwrap` — they survive upgrades. `bubblewrap` is now a `Recommends`. ([#694](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/694))

### Changed

- CI now validates the arm64 deb, RPM, and AppImage artifacts on native `ubuntu-22.04-arm` runners (previously only amd64 was tested), and the AppImage launch smoke test's process sweep is keyed to `mount_claude` and gated behind `$CI` so a local test run can't kill a developer's live Claude Desktop session. The launcher's orphaned-daemon reaper also gained mutation-tested BATS coverage. ([#691](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/691), [#693](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/693))
- The native-Wayland launch path now routes Quick Entry's global shortcut (`Ctrl+Alt+Space`) through the XDG GlobalShortcuts portal: `GlobalShortcutsPortal` is added to the `--enable-features` set, and all Chromium feature requests are merged into a single `--enable-features=` switch (Chromium honours only the last one, so the previous code could silently clobber features). GNOME Wayland users can opt into the portal route with `CLAUDE_USE_WAYLAND=1`, which works on GNOME ≤ 49 after a one-time portal permission dialog and fixes the focus-bound hotkey from [#404](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/404). The default GNOME session stays on XWayland (no rendering/IME regression risk); auto-selecting native Wayland on GNOME is deferred until it can be gated on a real render check. **On GNOME 50 / xdg-desktop-portal ≥ 1.20 the portal route is currently a no-op** — Electron/Chromium doesn't perform the portal's new host `Registry.Register` app-id handshake (filed upstream as [electron/electron#51875](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/51875)). `CLAUDE_USE_WAYLAND` is now tri-state: `1` native Wayland, `0` force XWayland, unset auto-detects. ([#404](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/404))

## [v2.0.18] — 2026-06-04

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.10628.2.

### Fixed

- Tray icon no longer stuck black at startup on dark desktops. `nativeTheme.shouldUseDarkColors` reads `false` for the first ~50 ms then flips `true`, but the leading-edge rebuild mutex latched the transient `false` and dropped the corrective `"updated"` events; the mutex is now trailing-edge (re-applies the final value) and the obsolete 3 s startup-suppression window was removed. ([#680](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/680), fixes [#679](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/679))
- Restored the in-place tray `setImage` fast-path ([#515](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/515)), which silently stopped applying after upstream changed the context-menu wiring from `setContextMenu(BUILDER())` to a prebuilt `setContextMenu(MENU)` object — `patch_tray_inplace_update` now resolves the builder in both shapes, so the duplicate-icon SNI race no longer regresses. ([#680](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/680))
- File-drop collector no longer re-attaches the app's own `app.asar` on every taskbar reopen. Electron's ASAR VFS shim returns `true` from `existsSync()` for `.asar` paths, so the second-instance argv collector dispatched `app.asar` to the file-drop handler and surfaced an attach prompt on each relaunch; it now rejects `.asar` paths, mirroring the existing `statSync` guard. ([#669](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/669), fixes [#668](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/668))

### Changed

- CI now runs a headless launch smoke test for the deb and rpm artifacts — previously only the AppImage actually booted, so a startup-only regression (e.g. the Fedora `SyntaxError`) could stay green on the formats it broke. A shared `run_launch_smoke_test` helper covers all three formats and gracefully skips when a container forbids Chromium's sandbox. ([#671](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/671), closes [#670](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/670))

## [v2.0.17] — 2026-06-04

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.10628.2.

### Fixed

- `addTrustedFolder` `.asar` guard re-anchored on the `async addTrustedFolder(…)` method declaration. Upstream Claude Desktop 1.10628.x folded the `LocalAgentModeSessions.addTrustedFolder: ${i}` log call into a comma-expression inside an `if`, removing the trailing `` `); `` the old anchor matched — `./build.sh` aborted with `[FAIL] addTrustedFolder anchor not found`. Both the parameter extraction and the injection point now key off the unminified method name, so they can't drift apart if upstream drops the log line. ([#685](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/685))

## [v2.0.16] — 2026-05-27

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.9255.0.

### Fixed

- Cowork spawn guard now captures `$`-prefixed minified function names (e.g. `$Be`) and uses `globalThis._lastSpawn` instead of a bare `_globalLastSpawn` identifier, fixing `ReferenceError: _globalLastSpawn is not defined` that broke Cowork on all platforms with upstream 1.9255.0. ([#660](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/660), fixes [#658](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/658), [#659](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/659), [#661](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/661))

## [v2.0.15] — 2026-05-27

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.9255.0.

### Fixed

- `StartupWMClass` aligned to `Claude` to match what Electron actually advertises via `productName`. The v2.0.14 value `claude-desktop` was silently ignored by Electron, causing orphan windows and duplicate gear icons on GNOME/KDE. Value centralized from 6 hardcoded locations to one source of truth in `build.sh`, with build-time substitution and a `productName` assertion guard. ([#655](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/655), fixes [#652](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/652))
- Tray variable extraction re-anchored on `.Tray()` literal instead of minifier-dependent syntax that upstream 1.9255.0 reshuffled. ([#657](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/657), fixes [#656](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/656))

## [v2.0.14] — 2026-05-25

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.8555.2.

### Fixed

- `WM_CLASS` and `StartupWMClass` aligned to `claude-desktop` across all formats (deb, RPM, AppImage, autostart). Resolves ambiguity with the Claude Code CLI (`claude`) and ensures consistent taskbar grouping on KDE/GNOME. ([#648](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/648), fixes [#647](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/647))

### Changed

- AppImage smoke test: replaced flat 10s sleep with readiness-marker poll (30s ceiling, 0.5s tick), unified cleanup trap to prevent 190MB `squashfs-root` leaks on interrupt. ([#646](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/646))

## [v2.0.13] — 2026-05-24

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.8555.2.

### Added

- `CLAUDE_KEEP_AWAKE=0` env var to suppress `powerSaveBlocker` sleep inhibitor that upstream holds indefinitely on Linux (no lifecycle management). Adds diagnostic logging for all `powerSaveBlocker` calls and `--doctor` visibility. ([#605](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/605))
- `--doctor` flags filesystems with `NAME_MAX < 200` (eCryptfs, certain encrypted overlays) and surfaces the LUKS-symlink workaround for cowork. Thanks @RayCharlizard, @lizthegrey for the repro. ([#614](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/614), fixes [#590](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/590))
- F11 fullscreen toggle via hidden menu accelerator — Linux parity with macOS green button / Windows F11. ([#638](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/638), fixes [#580](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/580))
- Linux org-plugins path (`/etc/claude/org-plugins`) added to platform switch, enabling MDM-managed plugin configuration. ([#639](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/639), fixes [#607](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/607))
- Top-level governance docs: this `CHANGELOG.md`, [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) (pre-release checklist + tag-driven CI flow), [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) (private GHSA reporting + in/out-of-scope), [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) (navigation hub), and [`docs/styleguides/docs_styleguide.md`](docs/styleguides/docs_styleguide.md) (page anatomy, naming, antipatterns). [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) gains explicit § Required reading, § Anti-patterns, and § Docs sections; [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) becomes a byte-identical mirror of the new body (was a 13-line stub) so non-Claude tools get the same instructions.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) "Before you start" triage section: where to go for a bug, a fix-in-hand, a new-feature ask, or a security report.
- `--password-store` keyring detection: probes D-Bus for kwallet6 / gnome-libsecret at startup and injects the flag before the app path, fixing session persistence on KDE Plasma and other desktops where `safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable()` returned false. Adds `CLAUDE_PASSWORD_STORE` env override and `--doctor` diagnostic. Thanks @dubreal. ([#611](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/611), fixes [#593](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/593))
- Unzip fallback for Node 24: detects missing electron binary after `extract-zip` silently no-ops and recovers from the `@electron/get` cache using system `unzip`. Thanks @JustinJLeopard. ([#631](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/631), fixes [#584](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/584))

### Fixed

- Config writes no longer drop externally-added `mcpServers`. The stale in-memory cache was overwriting disk on every preference change; now re-reads `mcpServers` from disk before each write. ([#643](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/643), fixes [#400](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/400))
- Menu bar toggle fires on Alt keyup only, not keydown — fixes Alt+Shift (language switch) and Alt+F4 accidentally triggering the menu bar. `CLAUDE_MENU_BAR=hidden` disables the Alt toggle entirely. ([#642](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/642), fixes [#630](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/630))
- `.asar` paths rejected in directory check, preventing Electron's ASAR VFS shim from dispatching `app.asar` to Cowork as a "folder drop". Fixes permission dialog on every launch, forced Cowork mode on reopen from tray, and "No conversation found" loop in Claude Code >=2.1.111. ([#640](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/640), fixes [#383](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/383), [#622](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/622), [#632](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/632))
- Identifier captures across all patch scripts hardened from `\w+` to `[$\w]+` (PCRE) / `[[:alnum:]_$]+` (ERE). Fixes broken idempotency guard in `tray.sh`, adds missing guards to `cowork.sh` patches 6/9/10, adds `\s*` whitespace tolerance to multiple patterns. ([#644](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/644))
- `exec` before Electron invocation in deb, RPM, and Nix launchers so Ctrl+C and signals forward correctly to the Electron process. ([#637](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/637), fixes [#424](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/424))
- `--class=Claude` added to launcher args ensuring WM_CLASS matches `StartupWMClass` in the .desktop file, preventing GNOME extension crashes from unexpected class values. ([#636](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/636), ref [#635](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/635))
- Sloppy/focus-follows-mouse: suppress redundant `webContents.focus()` calls that trigger X11 `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` raise-on-hover. Grace window handles stale `isFocused()` on tray-restore and minimize-restore. Thanks @tkrag. ([#589](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/589), fixes [#416](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/416))
- Tray: extracted JS identifier captures now accept `$` so the 1.8089.1 minified bundle ('`i$A`' menu handler) matches. Switches `\w+` to `[\w$]+`. ([#627](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/627), fixes [#625](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/625))
- RPM: silence "File listed twice" warning on `chrome-sandbox` by moving `chmod 4755` into `%install` (replaces `%attr` in `%files`). Adds regression guard that fails the build if the warning reappears. Thanks @JoshuaVlantis. ([#610](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/610), fixes [#609](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/609))
- Window close with `CLAUDE_QUIT_ON_CLOSE=1` now actively quits via `app.quit()` instead of relying on the bundled handler that hardcodes hide-to-tray on Linux. Rides upstream's own quit-in-progress guard. Thanks @phelps-matthew. ([#624](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/624), fixes [#623](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/623))
- node-pty: wipe upstream Windows binaries (winpty.dll, winpty-agent.exe, Windows `.node` files) before staging the Linux build, preventing PE32+ orphans in the packaged asar. Thanks @JoshuaVlantis. ([#597](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/597), addresses [#401](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/401))

### Changed

- CI injection hardening: moved `${{ steps.*.outputs.* }}` expressions from `run:` blocks to `env:` blocks in `issue-triage-v2.yml`. Build pipeline: `process.exit(0)` → `process.exit(1)` in `quick-window.sh` when patch anchors aren't found so CI fails instead of shipping broken patches. Packaging scriptlets: replaced `&> /dev/null` with `> /dev/null 2>&1` for dash compatibility in deb/RPM postinst. ([#641](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/641))
- Credit @lizthegrey, @sabiut, @typedrat, @RayCharlizard in README Acknowledgments. ([#626](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/626))
- Troubleshooting: new "Repeated Electron Crashes / GPU Process FATAL" section documenting `CLAUDE_DISABLE_GPU=1`. Adds tuning-rationale comments around the `--doctor` 3-in-7-days threshold and the `coredumpctl` `COMM=electron` assumption. Thanks @sabiut. ([#615](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/615), addresses [#608](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/608))
- Docs filenames are now lowercase kebab-case (`docs/building.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`); `STYLEGUIDE.md` moved to [`docs/styleguides/bash_styleguide.md`](docs/styleguides/bash_styleguide.md). Cross-references swept across README, CONTRIBUTING, CODEOWNERS, `.github/`, `.claude/`, `scripts/`, and `claude-desktop --doctor` user-facing output.
- `[$\w]+` is the codified identifier-capture convention for patch-script regexes (CONTRIBUTING § Patch-script regexes; `patch-engineer` agent examples updated to match). Closes a docs-vs-code gap that left the rule only in [`docs/learnings/patching-minified-js.md`](docs/learnings/patching-minified-js.md) — the same `\w+` trap fixed in patches by [#555](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/555) and [#627](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/627).

- RPM `chrome-sandbox` SUID now set via `%attr` instead of `%post chmod`. ([#539](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/539), [#595](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/595))
- No-op `autoUpdater` on Linux to defend against feed activation; mask thenable/coercion traps on the Proxy. ([#567](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/567), [#596](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/596))
- `node-pty` install fails loudly on `npm install` failure; require `gcc`/`make`/`python3`. ([#401](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/401), [#598](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/598))
- Fetch electron binary via `@electron/get`, drop `^41` pin; resolve from `work_dir` not script dir. ([#587](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/587))
- Dedupe packages mapped from multiple commands.

## [v2.0.10] — 2026-05-06

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.6259.0, 1.6259.1, 1.6608.0, 1.6608.2, 1.7196.0.

### Added

- `--doctor` surfaces recent Electron crashes with a `#583` pointer; `CLAUDE_DISABLE_GPU=1` opt-in for GPU-process fatal crashes. ([#583](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/583), [#585](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/585))
- `--doctor` detects IBus/GTK misconfigurations that break input. ([#572](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/572))
- Launcher: `CLAUDE_GTK_IM_MODULE` opt-in override. ([#571](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/571))
- Launcher: log session/IME env block at startup. ([#570](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/570))
- Linux compatibility test harness. ([#579](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/579))
- Lifecycle: notify and offer restart on in-place package upgrade. ([#564](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/564))
- `desktopName` set for Wayland window grouping. Thanks @jslatten. ([#562](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/562))

### Fixed

- Pin electron to `^41` to restore postinstall binary fetch. ([#584](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/584), [#586](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/586))
- Nix: make electron binary executable. ([#581](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/581))

- CI: force primary GPG key for `repomd.xml` signing. Thanks @ProfFlow. ([#566](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/566))
- DNF: set `metadata_expire=1h` on generated `.repo`. ([#551](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/551))
- BATS: isolate `cleanup_stale_cowork_socket` from host `pgrep` state. ([#534](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/534))

- Archive upstream report draft for #546 (filed as `anthropics/claude-code#55353`). ([#552](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/552))

## [v2.0.8] — 2026-05-02

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.5354.0 (unchanged from v2.0.7).

### Fixed

- Cowork starts again on Claude Desktop 1.5354.0. Upstream's minifier started emitting `$`-containing identifiers (`C$i`, `g$i`); two regex anchors in `scripts/patches/cowork.sh` used `\w+`, which doesn't match `$`. Patch 2b silently no-op'd, the Swift VM module assignment never landed, and you'd hit `Swift VM addon not available` at session init. Widens both anchors to `[\w$]+`. Patch 6 also moves from `indexOf` to `lastIndexOf` on the retry-delay anchor. Thanks @sirfaber, @HumboldtJoker, @zabka. ([#555](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/555), fixes [#558](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/558), likely fixes [#553](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/553) and [#445](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/445))

## [v2.0.7] — 2026-05-01

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.5354.0 (unchanged from v2.0.6).

### Added

- Linux in-app topbar works now. New `hybrid` titlebar mode is the default: native OS frame plus a BrowserView preload shim that satisfies claude.ai's UA gate, so the hamburger, sidebar, search, and nav buttons render and are clickable. Layout is stacked (DE titlebar above the in-app topbar) rather than combined like Windows. Set `CLAUDE_TITLEBAR_STYLE=native` to opt out and hide the in-app topbar. The upstream `frame:false` + WCO config is preserved as `hidden` for investigation but still has unclickable buttons on Linux; `--doctor` warns when it's active. Verified on KDE Plasma X11/Wayland and Hyprland; GNOME, Sway, Niri, and NixOS pending. ([#538](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/538))

## [v2.0.6] — 2026-05-01

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.5354.0. Absorbs three upstream bumps from v2.0.5: 1.4758.0, 1.5220.0, 1.5354.0.

### Added

- Cowork bwrap mounts accept a `{src, dst}` form, so you can map a host directory under `$HOME` onto a different path inside the sandbox. Unlocks persistent-`/tmp` so Bash tool calls don't wipe state between invocations. String form unchanged. Thanks @cbonnissent. ([#531](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/531))
- `--doctor` warns when `COWORK_VM_BACKEND` is set to an unknown value instead of silently falling through to auto-detect; adds a `COWORK_VM_BACKEND` row and a Cowork Backend section to `docs/configuration.md`. Thanks @CyPack. ([#324](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/324))
- `--doctor` warns when an additional bwrap mount destination shadows a default sandbox path like `/usr`, `/etc`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib`. ([#531](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/531))
- Troubleshooting entries for Cowork VM connection timeout, virtiofsd outside `$PATH` on Fedora/RHEL (`/usr/libexec/virtiofsd`), and Fedora tmpfs `EXDEV` errors. ([#324](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/324))

### Fixed

- Closing the window no longer kills the app on Linux. The X button hides to tray, matching Windows and macOS. Quit explicitly with Ctrl+Q, the tray menu, or your DE's quit shortcut. Set `CLAUDE_QUIT_ON_CLOSE=1` to restore the old behavior. Fixes scheduled tasks and `/schedule` firings getting silently dropped overnight. Thanks @lizthegrey. ([#451](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/451))
- "Run on startup" toggle persists on Linux now. Electron's `setLoginItemSettings` isn't implemented on Linux; the wrapper backs the toggle with `~/.config/autostart/claude-desktop.desktop` per the XDG Autostart spec. Thanks @lizthegrey. ([#450](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/450), fixes [#128](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/128))
- Tray icon updates in place on OS theme change instead of briefly duplicating on KDE Plasma. Uses `setImage` + `setContextMenu` rather than destroy + recreate. Thanks @IliyaBrook. ([#515](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/515))
- Window visibility check works again after an upstream minified-name change broke it. Thanks @Andrej730. ([#496](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/496), fixes [#495](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/495))

### Changed

- APT/DNF install instructions point at `pkg.claude-desktop-debian.dev` directly, bypassing the GitHub Pages 301. Pages serves the redirect over `http://` because it can't provision a cert for the `pkg.` subdomain (DNS belongs to the Cloudflare Worker), and `apt` refuses HTTPS→HTTP downgrades. DNF was unaffected. ([#510](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/510), [#514](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/514))

## [v2.0.5] — 2026-04-23

Wrapper/packaging update; upstream Claude Desktop unchanged at 1.3883.0.

### Fixed

- CI: smoke test accepts release-assets CDN hostname. ([#509](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/509))
- Strip CRLF from `cowork-plugin-shim.sh` during staging. ([#499](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/499), [#505](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/505))

- Worker: use `raw.githubusercontent.com` as origin to avoid Pages 301 loop. ([#504](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/504))

### Changed

- Worker: flip route from staging to production for Phase 4a. ([#503](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/503))

## [v2.0.3] — 2026-04-23

Wrapper/packaging update; upstream Claude Desktop unchanged at 1.3883.0. No GitHub Release published.

### Added

- APT/DNF Worker scaffolding. ([#498](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/498))

### Fixed

- CI: resolve DNF Worker chain blockers. ([#500](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/500), [#501](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/501), [#502](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/502))

### Changed

- Plan APT/DNF distribution via Cloudflare Worker. ([#493](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/493), [#494](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/494))

## [v2.0.2] — 2026-04-22

## [v2.0.1] — 2026-04-21

Wrapper/packaging update; tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.3561.0, 1.3883.0.

### Added

- Triage Phase 4 sub-PRs: Stage 8c enhancement-design variant, suspicious-input tells, `regression_of` + edit-during-triage. ([#470](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/470), [#471](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/471), [#472](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/472))

- Rename `feature` classification to `enhancement` in triage. ([#466](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/466))

## [v2.0.0] — 2026-04-20

First v2 wrapper release; tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.3109.0, 1.3561.0.

### Added

- `cowork-vm-daemon` learnings doc and Anthropic & Partners plugin install flow doc. ([#439](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/439))
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` for per-subsystem review ownership.
- `shellcheck -x` to follow sourced modules in CI.

### Fixed

- Restore `cowork-vm-service` daemon recovery after crash. ([#408](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/408))
- Forward `userSelectedFolders[0]` as `sharedCwdPath` on cowork spawn. ([#412](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/412), [#436](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/436))
- Strip mode on `node-pty` cp at source; retire `chmod`. Chmod `node-pty` unpacked files before overwriting in Nix builds. ([#432](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/432), [#438](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/438))
