# Building from Source

## Prerequisites

- Linux distribution (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora/RHEL, or other)
- Git
- Basic build tools (automatically installed by the script)

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/samirhvbr/SHVIA-DESKTOP.git
cd SHVIA-DESKTOP

# Build with auto-detected format (based on your distro)
./build.sh

# Or specify a format explicitly:
./build.sh --build deb       # Debian/Ubuntu .deb package
./build.sh --build rpm       # Fedora/RHEL .rpm package
./build.sh --build appimage  # Distribution-agnostic AppImage
./build.sh --build nix       # Nix derivation (patch only, used by flake)

# Build with custom options
./build.sh --build deb --clean no  # Keep intermediate files

# Build using a locally downloaded installer
# (useful when the bundled download URL is outdated)
./build.sh --exe /path/to/Claude-Setup.exe
```

The build script automatically detects your distribution and selects the appropriate package format:
| Distribution | Default Format | Package Manager |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Debian, Ubuntu, Mint | `.deb` | apt |
| Fedora, RHEL, CentOS | `.rpm` | dnf |
| NixOS | `nix` | nix |
| Arch Linux | `.AppImage` (via AUR) | yay/paru |
| Other | `.AppImage` | - |

## Build Environment Variables

The build pulls the Electron prebuilt binary from `github.com/electron/electron/releases` via `@electron/get`. Two upstream environment variables let you redirect that fetch:

- `ELECTRON_MIRROR` — base URL to fetch Electron releases from instead of GitHub. Useful for mirrors or local proxies. Example: `ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/`.
- `ELECTRON_CUSTOM_DIR` — overrides the path segment after the mirror. Defaults to `v{version}`.

The cache location is fixed at `~/.cache/electron/` (resolved by `@electron/get` via `envPaths`) and is reused across builds. `ELECTRON_CACHE` is **not** read by `@electron/get` — set `ELECTRON_MIRROR` if you need to avoid the public CDN.

The pinned Electron version lives in `scripts/setup/dependencies.sh` (`electron_version`) and must match `build-reference/app-extracted/package.json` — the upstream Claude Desktop `app.asar` is built against a specific Electron major and running a different one is unsupported.

## Installing the Built Package

### For .deb packages (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install ./shvia-desktop_VERSION_ARCHITECTURE.deb
# Or: sudo dpkg -i ./shvia-desktop_VERSION_ARCHITECTURE.deb

# If you encounter dependency issues:
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

### For .rpm packages (Fedora/RHEL)

```bash
sudo dnf install ./shvia-desktop-VERSION-1.ARCH.rpm
# Or: sudo rpm -i ./shvia-desktop-VERSION-1.ARCH.rpm
```

### For AppImages

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x ./shvia-desktop-*.AppImage

# Run directly
./shvia-desktop-*.AppImage

# Or integrate with your system using Gear Lever
```

**Note:** AppImage login requires proper desktop integration. Use [Gear Lever](https://flathub.org/apps/it.mijorus.gearlever) or manually install the provided `.desktop` file to `~/.local/share/applications/`.

**Automatic Updates:** AppImages downloaded from GitHub releases include embedded update information and work seamlessly with Gear Lever for automatic updates. Locally-built AppImages can be manually configured for updates in Gear Lever.

### For NixOS

The repository includes a Nix flake. Build and install directly:

```bash
# Build the package
nix build .#shvia-desktop

# Build the FHS-wrapped variant (for MCP server support)
nix build .#shvia-desktop-fhs

# Run without installing
nix run .#shvia-desktop
```

For declarative NixOS installation, see the [README](../README.md#using-nix-flake-nixos).

## Technical Details

### How It Works

Claude Desktop is an Electron application distributed for Windows. This project:

1. Downloads the official Windows installer
2. Extracts application resources
3. Replaces Windows-specific native modules with Linux-compatible implementations
4. Repackages as one of:
   - **Debian package (.deb)**: For Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives
   - **RPM package (.rpm)**: For Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, and derivatives
   - **AppImage**: Portable, distribution-agnostic executable
   - **Nix package**: For NixOS, via the included flake

### Build Process

The build script (`build.sh`) handles:
- Dependency checking and installation
- Resource extraction from Windows installer
- Icon processing for Linux desktop standards
- Native module replacement
- Package generation based on selected format

### Automated Version Detection

A GitHub Actions workflow runs daily to check for new Claude Desktop releases:

1. Uses Playwright to resolve Anthropic's Cloudflare-protected download redirects
2. Compares resolved URLs with those in `scripts/setup/detect-host.sh`
3. If a new version is detected:
   - Updates `scripts/setup/detect-host.sh` with new download URLs
   - Updates `nix/shvia-desktop.nix` with new version, URLs, and SRI hashes
   - Creates a new release tag
   - Triggers automated builds for both architectures

This ensures the repository stays up-to-date with official releases automatically.

### Manual Updates

If you need to build with a specific version before the automation catches it:

1. **Use a local installer**: Download the latest installer from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download) and build with:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh --exe /path/to/Claude-Setup.exe
   ```

2. **Update the URL**: Modify the `claude_download_url` assignments in `scripts/setup/detect-host.sh` (inside the `detect_architecture` case statement).
